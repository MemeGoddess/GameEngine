# GameEngine
A simple game engine I made for both DirectX and OpenGL (2018, Age 19). Originally made 7th of April, 2018, I wanted to explore game development using C# but didn't want to use Unity, so I made my own engine. This was a personal project to learn new things, now uploaded to demonstrate my coding over the years.
