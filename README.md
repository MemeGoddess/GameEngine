# GameEngine
Originally made 7th of April, 2018, I wanted to explore game development using C# but didn't want to use Unity, so I made my own engine. The engine is an isometric perspective with texture mapping. This was a personal project to learn new things, now uploaded to demonstrate my coding over the years.
